üöÄ Namaste React - Food Ordering App
This repository contains the code for a modern food ordering application built using React. This project serves as a comprehensive learning journey through core React concepts, state management, routing, API integrations, and more, inspired by the "Namaste React" course.

‚ú® Features
Restaurant Listing: Browse a list of popular restaurants.

Dynamic Menu Pages: View detailed menus for each restaurant, fetched from a live API.

Shimmer UI: Provides a smooth loading experience while data is being fetched.

Client-Side Routing: Seamless navigation between Home, About, Contact, and Restaurant Menu pages using React Router.

Responsive Design: (Planned/Future) Ensure the application looks good on various devices.

Login/Logout Toggle: A simple button to demonstrate state management.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router DOM: For declarative routing in React applications.

Parcel: A blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler.

Tailwind CSS: (If you're using it, add this) A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

Swiggy Public API: Used for fetching restaurant and menu data.
